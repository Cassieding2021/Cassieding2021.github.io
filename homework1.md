### üèÜLecture Notes
#### 1. Gene: Coding & Noncoding
- Humans Have So Few Genes
- Many different types of RNAs
- Coding & Noncoding genes

#### 2. Method: Sequencing & Computing
##### ‚ú®THREE steps of bioinformatics
1. **Information**: Medical and/or Biological Data
2. **Model**: Mathematical and Probability Model
    - Type I. Regression Model: Linear ‚Üí Logistic Regression
    - Type II. Tree Model: Decision Tree ‚Üí Random forest
    - Type III. Neural Network Model ‚Üí Deep Learning
3. **Algorithm**: Computational Algorithm
##### ‚ú®DIFFERENCES between algorithm and model
1. **Algorithm**: 
    - An algorithm is a ==step-by-step procedure== or set of rules to solve a specific problem or perform a specific task.
    - Example: Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
2. **Model**: 
    - Models are built using algorithms, along with data, to make predictions, draw inferences, or understand underlying patterns.
    - Models are specific to a particular problem domain and often ==require training on data== to learn patterns and relationships.
    - Example: Linear Regression Model, Neural Network Model, etc.
